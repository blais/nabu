   "Nabu is the Babylonian god of wisdom and writing, worshipped by
   Babylonians as the son of Marduk and his consort, Sarpanitum, and as
   the grandson of Ea."

   ---(From `Wikipedia <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nabu>`_)

Description
===========

Nabu is a system for allowing users to easily create large amounts of
relevant information and publish this information in a semantically
meaningful way on a remote server, which can then be accessed by various
services with the intent to build useful services on top of this
semantically rich storage.

Concretely, Nabu allows you to keep various types of information into
simple text files (in `restructuredtext
<http://docutils.sourceforge.net>`_ format, with simple added
directives), and to have these informations parsed, organized and
available remotely, and to have a web server display the information in
various ways.  For example, you can have files with text, links, contact
info, etc. in them and this information gets extracted and becomes
available for a blog system to use.

For more details, see the design document and project proposal under the
``doc`` subdirectory.




Nabu is cool, because:

- you edit files locally, with your favourite editor.  

- the organization of the files in subdirectories has nothing to do with how the
  content is presented.  It effectively offers you a sandbox for creating
  content, and then how you organize or present the content is dictated by ways
  that *you* decide, potentially independent of the file organization structure;

- the valuable source of the information, the text files, remains with you, and
  you are free to manage them in any way you prefer, with any version control
  system you like (if you want to do that);

- it does not dictate how the information is presented/served to the clients;

- various semantic things are automatically extracted from your document.  These
  semantic things are easily written with little code and are configurable.
  Nabu comes with many content extractors (generic and specific ones);

- a light-weight program with little dependencies is used to upload the files on
  the server.  The server parses the content.  This maximizes the potential that
  you will be able to use Nabu anywhere;



Nabu is not:

- a Wiki

- a Blogging system

- a word processing system



Nabu is:  a way to add content and extract semantic from this content-- no
presentation layer.  You can build the presentation with any web development
framework that can access an SQL database.

Components
----------

Nabu Client
   Contains a publisher that reads files on the local client filesystem and that
   figures out which ones are meant for publication, connects to the Nabu Server
   and asks for comparison of the files and incrementally uploads the files that
   have changed to update the content on the server.
   The client code may also contain a easy-to-use editor for source files.

Nabu Server
   Receives updates of the source files from the publisher client, figures out
   which files have changed since the last update by serving MD5 sums of the
   files it has processed, and makes the necessary updates.  The content is
   stored in a database after having been parsed.

Presenter / Web Application
   Uses the content stored on the database by the server, and provides a web
   front to the data by providing various services, like a blog, an addressbook,
   etc.  It also provides a web application with users, and various levels of
   access to the various chunks of data.


Download
========

This software is not released yet, and it might never make it to the open
source world.  We're just not sure what we're going to do with this at
this point (2005-06-04).


Reporting Bugs
==============

Installation
============

- *client*: you need Python-2.3 (and perhaps some kind of shell environment
  (cmd.exe can do on Windows));

- *server*: you need apache and mod_python, Python-2.4 and the PostgreSQL
  database server;

- *app*: you need some web application framework of your choice.  We provide an
  example with a CGI script to debug the contents extracted to the database.
