==================
    TODO: nabu
==================

- finish removing all the SQLObject craporola!!!!

  * Move the sqlobject extractor?  Nah, it should be the last trace of sqlobject.
  * Remove references to SQLObject in docs and web
  * Release new version.

- Add comparison to Desktop Search on web page and presentation

- Finish extractors and use it.

- Make the html rendering not render output errors.




- support encrypted files from the publisher

  - problem: how do we identify documents to be published without decrypting?

    - emacs config must keep plain text at the top of the file when decrypting
      in a variable and add it back in when reencrypting

- shares some of the advantages of XML, structured hirarchical tree of nodes


:server setup:
- implement asynchronous document processing on the server

- check database locking issues in more detail?


:extractors:
- warn on files that have no titles (add minimum requirements extractor)

- there should be and .. end directive to stop the processing from that point on.
  - .. disclosure:: private directive could achieve something similar

- add a generic field list parser for creating new types of records without
  code: the entry type is the first field list, if it matches some pattern
  (e.g. if it's empty);

- url extractor: when right after a title, a list of URLs should use the title
  as the description string


:presentation:
- add my own HTML writer to remove comment nodes completely, so they don't show
  up in the HTML as comments;
