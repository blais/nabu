============
 TODO: nabu
============

- how are *~ backup files dealt with

- add to dump command: ability to dump contents like the page

  - if there is an id

- remove all traces of the document


:server:
- provide a way to debug the contents of the document, printing out the
  structure (nabu-contents should add that, next to the html)





:publisher:

- setup automated publish on commit using
  - CVS
  - Subversion
  ---> and document!

- support encrypted files from the publisher

  - problem: how do we identify documents to be published without decrypting?

    - emacs config must keep plain text at the top of the file when decrypting
      in a variable and add it back in when reencrypting

- handle authorization failure more gracefully

- make sure that the errors format can be processed by emacs


:server setup and beta users:
- important!  in the server, we *must* get the username from the authentication,
  not as given, change to always use 'REMOTE_USER' for this purpose.

- separate the nabu transforms from the standalone reader transforms and keep
  that as the source documents

  * eventually we could reprocess the entire documents without uploading again,
    just having to run the nabu transforms/extractors

- add parameters to the nabu-contents.cgi script:
  - user (required)
  - type (optional, if not present print list)
  - rendering is for debugging: generic field/value style

- add users to the storage and contents fetching script
  - setup CGI on my server
  - write a script to add databases for new users
  - send script to friends to try it out

- add upload date to all material stored in the database
- add upload user to all material stored in the database
  - this way, multiple users can fill in the same "nabu" storage to 
    produce shared content

- automatically adding columns for entry "fields" that are not currently
  in the database, makes the data model looser

  - find out how to programmatically add columns to the database

- make the server run with multiple threads to process all files after
  communication

- database locking issues?




:entries:
- warn on files that have no titles (add minimum requirements entryform)

- find a way for the entryforms to be "loosely coupled" with the data model on
  the server.

- add a generic field list parser for creating new types of records without
  code: the entry type is the first field list, if it matches some pattern
  (e.g. if it's empty);

- comment nodes could be stripped off complete

- there should be and .. end directive to stop the processing from that point on.
  - .. disclosure:: private directive could achieve something similar



:documentation:
- create home page to describe what it is;

- naming: 

  * Tinba: Tinba Is Not a Blog A...
  * xNB: x is not a blog
  * NABO: Not A Blog Only




:tests:
  - test with other encodings than utf-8 in source files
  - duplicate Id error test


:source files:
- uniformize the :Id: tags


Rejected or Indefinitely-postponed Ideas
----------------------------------------

- ``include-only`` option in the publisher:

    - restrict finder to certain extensions (default is all files)
      - test with .txt extensions

  For now, we think that the ``exclude`` option combined with the
  discrimintation of having markers in only certain files is sufficient for most
  usage.  And you can customize the marker.  Also, since we're just reading the
  header of the files, it is still really fast even when there are a lot of
  large binary files.

- extend the server to allow the publisher to send already parsed doctree as
  pickled to the server.

  We can do this later: this is only an optimization to ease the load on the
  server.


- we need to find out if it is possible from a CGI script to let the client
  know that we're done, and to keep running on the server, while letting the
  client exit?  note that there might be some options in the client for that
  purpose. find out.

  Do this later. This could be interesting.

- do we require a user/password?  

  For now, yes.


- do we even bother entering partial data when there are errors?
  make it an option on the server?

  Do this later.

- print processing/pending queue (server must provide that information)

  We need an interface for servers that implement deferred processing.  We
  should be able to query this processing queue to find out if our documents
  have been processed so we can query for errors.


- when pushing new documents to the server, spit a warning if there is a clash
  of documents between users? 

  This should be in the server config and perhaps belongs to the domain of
  policy.


- store length or number of nodes in the sources document, to be able to
  evaluate the size or time to perform a specific task on the data.

  Do this later.
