==================
    TODO: nabu
==================

- When we change a document's unique Id, the old document remains in the
  databaseâ€¦ is there anything we can do about that?

- We need to detect encoding errors better, I have too many documents which do
  not get detected/guessed automatically

- Write an extractor for all my google maps links and create a list of them, so
  I can find locations easily.  MapExtractor

- Write an extractor for dictionary definitions;  in this format:

    defn: unwonted
       Definition of unwontedness.


- Find how to suppress output of errors in HTML conversion, to avoid catching
  this output in the extractors and having this output pollute the contents of
  the extractors.

    e.g. photography.txt and contacts.

- Nabu ``-l`` is broken.

- Test and check with docutils 0.4

- Revise and fix ``client.py --dump``

- Add a "--config=" option to client rather than force setting NABURC.

- Make the html rendering not render output errors.

- support encrypted files from the publisher

  - problem: how do we identify documents to be published without decrypting?

    - emacs config must keep plain text at the top of the file when decrypting
      in a variable and add it back in when reencrypting

- shares some of the advantages of XML, structured hirarchical tree of nodes


:server setup:
- implement asynchronous document processing on the server

- check database locking issues in more detail?


:extractors:
- warn on files that have no titles (add minimum requirements extractor)

- there should be and .. end directive to stop the processing from that point on.
  - .. disclosure:: private directive could achieve something similar

- add a generic field list parser for creating new types of records without
  code: the entry type is the first field list, if it matches some pattern
  (e.g. if it's empty);

- url extractor: when right after a title, a list of URLs should use the title
  as the description string


:presentation:
- add my own HTML writer to remove comment nodes completely, so they don't show
  up in the HTML as comments;

- Add comparison to Desktop Search on web page and presentation
