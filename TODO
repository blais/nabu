==================
    TODO: nabu
==================

:client:
- add config notes to server? to docs?



:web:
- create a separate demo page with explanations, etc.


:publisher:
- setup automated publish on commit using
  - CVS
  - Subversion
  ---> and document!

- support encrypted files from the publisher

  - problem: how do we identify documents to be published without decrypting?

    - emacs config must keep plain text at the top of the file when decrypting
      in a variable and add it back in when reencrypting


:server setup:
- implement asynchronous document processing on the server

- database locking issues?



:tests:
  - test with files with DOS CRLF chars
  - test with other encodings than utf-8 in source file


:extractors:
- warn on files that have no titles (add minimum requirements entryform)

- add a generic field list parser for creating new types of records without
  code: the entry type is the first field list, if it matches some pattern
  (e.g. if it's empty);

- add my own HTML writer to remove comment nodes completely, so they don't show
  up in the HTML as comments;

- there should be and .. end directive to stop the processing from that point on.
  - .. disclosure:: private directive could achieve something similar
