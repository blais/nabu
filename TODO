==================
    TODO: nabu
==================

- support encrypted files from the publisher

  - problem: how do we identify documents to be published without decrypting?

    - emacs config must keep plain text at the top of the file when decrypting
      in a variable and add it back in when reencrypting


:server setup:
- implement asynchronous document processing on the server

- check database locking issues in more detail?


:extractors:
- warn on files that have no titles (add minimum requirements extractor)

- there should be and .. end directive to stop the processing from that point on.
  - .. disclosure:: private directive could achieve something similar

- add a generic field list parser for creating new types of records without
  code: the entry type is the first field list, if it matches some pattern
  (e.g. if it's empty);


:presentation:
- add my own HTML writer to remove comment nodes completely, so they don't show
  up in the HTML as comments;
