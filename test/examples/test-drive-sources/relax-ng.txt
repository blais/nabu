   Personal notes on installing RELAX-NG -related tools to be able to validate
   my XML documents with it.

Notes
=====

There are two forms of RELAX-NG schemas:

1. XML syntax: ``.rng``;
2. XML syntax: ``.rnc``;

Converting DTD to RNG
=====================

Installed a program called ``trang`` in ``/usr/local`` to convert my DTDs into
RELAX-NG XML documents.  Downloaded the GCJ version and compiled Java code into
an executable (had to fiddle with CLASSPATH, see ``linux-config`` doc).

Validation
==========

This does it::

  xmllint --noout  --relaxng ../share/rng/album.rng album-1.xml

Output::

  album-1.xml validates
