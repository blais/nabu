   Personal notes on yoga.


What is meant by Awareness
--------------------------

Kriya yoga is more interested in awareness than concentration. What do we mean
by awareness? By awareness we mean conscious attention of thoughts or of
objects, either external or internal, without necessarily being
onepointed. Simultaneously, and this is most important, the word implies that
the individual knows that his attention is at a particular place or on a train
of thought. The word implies a relationship between the activity of perception
and the perceiver. If a person does not know he is perceiving something, then he
is not aware. Awareness implies that the individual does not try to suppress his
ever-arising stream of thoughts, even if they have nothing to do with his
direction of perception; he merely lets the thoughts arise and dissappear,
remaining as a witness to them. Other people might understand something
different by the word awareness, but the previous explanation is what we
mean. When a person is sufficiently relaxed, especially in the deeper layers of
the subconscious, then awareness will lead to onepointedness or concentration.

The Definition of Yoga
----------------------

by Peggy Kelley

YOGA is a Sanskrit word meaning UNION or JOINING.

Yoga is the practice of being completely, wholeheartedly present or mindful in
one's life, whether driving, working, practicing Yoga poses, cooking, playing
with a child, or making love.

According to B.K.S. Iyengar, there are 7 types of yoga:
    Hatha Yoga - the yoga of asanas or physical poses
    Bhakti Yoga - the yoga of devotion
    Jnana Yoga - the yoga of wisdom or intellectual pursuit
    Mantric Yoga - the yoga of sound vibration
    Laya Yoga - the yoga of meditation
    Raja Yoga - the yoga of the eightfold path of Patanjali's Yoga Sutras
    Karma Yoga - the yoga of service

All Yoga practice can lead to heightened awareness and greater joy. Our Western
culture has embraced Hatha Yoga in particular, acknowledging its positive
effects on both body and mind. Hatha Yoga balances strength with flexibility,
tones the vital organs, offers restorative healing and provides aerobic
conditioning.

Today's lifestyles are hectic and time can be a limiting factor, so many
teachers have made videos or written books.

When choosing a yoga class, ask your teacher where he or she was trained, if
they're certified, and how long they've been teaching. Be sure to tell your
teacher if you have ANY kind of injury or illness and don't be afraid to trust
your intuition regarding which class is right for you.

Common "Styles" of Yoga
-----------------------

Ananda Yoga
  A gentle, meditative style of Hatha yoga, developed by a Westerner, Swami
  Kriyananda. Kriyandana had been a student of Swami Paramhansa Yogananda, the
  author of Autobiography of a Yogi. The Expanding Light is Ananda's retreat
  center in Nevada City, California. [http://www.expandinglight.org/]

Anusara Yoga
  Developed by John Friend, an American Yogi who trained in the Iyengar and
  Ashtanga traditions before developing Anusara, this method combines alignment,
  attitude and action. Anusara can be challenging, but is always nurturing as
  well. Meditation is part of the practice, so there will be some silent sitting
  time in a class in this style. [http://www.anusara.com/]

Ashtanga Yoga/Power Yoga
  Pattabhi Jois, (who along with Iyengar studied with Krishnamacharya, the great
  Yogi of Madras) uses the word Ashtanga to apply to his very challenging and
  gymnastic series of yoga flows or vinyasas. These flows begin with what is
  called First Series and go through Fifth or Sixth series, depending on whom
  you ask. An Ashstanga Yoga practice follows a set sequence (series) from
  beginning to end without stopping. This is designed to develop and maintain
  heat in the body, which cleanses at a cellular level. Beryl and Thom Birch
  teach Ashtanga Yoga but call it Power Yoga, and wrote a book by that
  title. Basically Power Yoga and Ashtanga Yoga are the same
  thing. [http://www.ashtanga.com/ or http://www.power-yoga.com/]
 
Bikram Yoga
  A style of asana which involves working in a very hot room, up to
  100F. Usually the same series of 26 poses is taught, including standing,
  balancing, backbending, and twisting poses. You can read more about Bikram in
  Yoga Journal, March/April 2000 or at http://www.bikramyoga.com.

Hatha Yoga
  Most American Yoga classes are a variation of Hatha Yoga (physical
  postures). The postures of Hatha Yoga range from the seemingly simple
  (standing erect) to the very complex (putting your feet behind your head and
  balancing on your hands). Hatha is Sanskrit word that consists of two
  syllables, ha, which referrs to the sun or solar energy, and tha, which refers
  to the moon or lunar energy. Thus, Hatha Yoga is often defined as a physical
  practice that balances the solar/lunar, masculine/feminine, or hard/soft
  energies in the human body. It's also sometimes defined as the aspect of Yoga
  in where adamant will-power is applied. Some Yoga classes take a hard-core,
  athletic, aerobic approach to the practice of poses (for example, "Power
  Yoga", "Ashtanga Yoga", or "Hard-Work" yoga). Other Yoga classes take a
  slower-paced, more meditative approach to the practice of the poses (usually
  called "Restorative", "Meditative" or "Gentle-Work" classes).

Integral Yoga 
  Originated by Swami Satchidananda, whose organization is
  headquartered in Virginia, Integral Yoga is a meditative approach. Based on
  his motto, "peaceful, easeful, useful," the poses are linked slowly together
  emphasizing easy flow of breath. A class will usually include breathwork,
  meditation and guided relaxation. [http://www.integralyogaofnewyork.org/]

Iyengar Yoga 
  This may be the most popular style of Hatha Yoga in the U.S. today
  due to the great skill and teaching genius of the 80+ year old B.K.S. Iyengar
  of Poona, India. He has taught thousands of students from the world over and
  focuses on precise attention to alignment in every pose. Basic to his system
  are the standing poses, often held longer than they are in other styles of
  Yoga. Props such as blocks, belts, and blankets are sometimes used in
  Iyengar-style classes to give the body support. An Iyengar yoga class may be
  slow, soft and meditative if it is billed as "restorative", or it may be
  extremely challenging and physically demanding if it is billed as "hard
  work". Read more about Iyengar in Yoga Journal: Nov/Dec. 97, and May/June
  99. [http://comnet.org/iynaus/]

Kripalu Yoga 
  Created by Amrit Desai whose teacher, Kripaluvananda, supervised
  the creation of a three-stage approach to yoga asana. First, there is willful
  practice that concentrates on alignment, breath, and mind/body
  connection. Second, there is willful surrender involving holding the poses
  beyond the level of tolerance deepening the mind/body connection. Third, there
  is meditation in motion, where students endeavor to completely release
  internal tensions and develop greater trust in the wisdom of the body to enter
  a state of deep meditation. The Kripalu organization has a lovely center in
  the Berkshire Mountains of Western
  Massachusetts.[http://www.kripalushop.org/kripalu/]

Kundalini Yoga
  Yogi Bhajan, who is centered in New Mexico, developed the 3HO foundation,
  based on teaching a Yoga for Happiness, Holiness and Healthiness. According to
  Bhajan, this tradition was secret in India before he brought it to the west. A
  Kundalini class will usually combine dynamic postures, breathing, chanting and
  meditation on mantras. [http://www.3HO.org]

Sivananda Yoga
  Developed by students of Swami Sivananda of Rishikesh, India, Sivananda Yoga
  emphasizes a five pointed approach. Proper exercise, proper breathing, proper
  relaxation, proper diet, and positive thinking and meditation. The asana
  (postures) practice is based on 12 basic poses, and Sivananda classes usually
  also include chanting, breathwork, and meditation. The organization has
  several centers worldwide. [http://www.sivananda.org/]

Viniyoga
  Developed by T.V.K. Desikachar based on his studies with his father
  Krishnamacharya (also the guru of Iyengar and Pattabhi Jois). This style of
  yoga emphasizes gently combining breath with movement, maximizing the
  appropriate aspect of each individual based on their age and condition. For a
  young person, the emphasis is on healthy growth and development, for the
  adult, maintaining health for good productivity is emphasized, for the older
  person, developing the quest for self-realization is emphasized. Gary Kraftsow
  of Hawaii and Stan Hafner of Austin are senior U.S. students of
  Desikachar. [Gary at http://www.viniyoga.com/ and Stan at
