Interesting Fonts
=================

::

  font: 9pt/17pt georgia;
  font: italic normal 12pt georgia;

  font: 8pt/11pt "Times New Roman", serif, georgia;
  font: italic 10pt/22pt georgia;

  font: 8pt/16pt georgia;

From http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/a/javascript/2001/07/26/css_fonts.html?page=2:

  There are five generic font families, although two of them are not particularly
  useful. These families are:

  * Serif: fonts such as Times, New Century Schoolbook, and Garamond. The
    letters in a Serif font feature small caps, lines, and other decorations
    -- the serifs which give this family its name.

  * Sans-serif: fonts such as Geneva, Helvetica, and Arial. The letters of
    Sans-serif fonts have no serifs.

  * Monospace: fonts where each character is the same width. This is in
    contrast to the vast majority of fonts, which are proportional -- that is,
    the amount of horizontal space taken up by each letter is in proportion to
    its width, so that i is not as wide as w. Courier is the most commonly
    used monospace font. Note that monospace fonts can also be either Serif or
    Sans-serif. Courier is a Serif font, for example.  *

  * Cursive: fonts which emulate human handwriting, such as Author. Cursive
    fonts are typically quite difficult to read on-screen, and their use is
    generally discouraged. Some browsers cannot even find and use cursive
    fonts.

  * Fantasy: fonts which do not fit into the previous four families, such as
    Zapf Dingbats, Ventilate, or Klingon. Because this is a catch-all
    category, it is defined more by what it is not (the other four font
    families) than what it is.

  **Cross-Platform Fonts**

  In a world with many different operating systems, it is important to know what
  fonts are widely available across platforms, and what close alternatives
  exist. Although you may like the look of Sand, and you know it's installed on
  most modern Macs, its non-existence on Windows machines means that your page
  will turn out looking very different on various machines.

  For a basic guide, please consult the following table. Note that the entry for
  Fantasy fonts is fairly suspect, since the catch-all nature of this font family
  means that the lack of a specific font could cause another, wildly different
  font to be substituted.

  Generic Family	Common Macintosh Fonts			   Common Windows Fonts

  Serif		Times, New Century Schoolbook, Palatino	   Times New Roman, Georgia

  Sans-serif 	Helvetica, Arial, Verdana*		   Arial, Tahoma, Verdana*

  Monospace 	Courier					   Courier New

  Cursive 	-- 	--

  Fantasy 	WingDings, Symbol			   WingDings, Symbol





Individual Tricks
=================

Justify your text
-----------------

::

  text-align: justify;

Use Acronym where it makes sense
--------------------------------

The ACRONYM element is used to markup acronyms. The TITLE attribute is useful in
conjunction with ACRONYM to give the long form of the acronym, allowing visual
browsers to provide the long form as a "tooltip". Examples::

  <ACRONYM TITLE="North Atlantic Treaty Organization">NATO</ACRONYM>

It may be a good idea to make them look nicer::

  acronym {
    border-bottom: none; }


Replacing text by an image
--------------------------

::

  div {
    background-image:url("hello_world.gif");
    background-repeat:no-repeat;
    height:35px; }

  span {
    display:none; }

  ...

  <div>
    <span>Hello world!</span>
  </div>

Assign a class to all text that needs to be "swapped" to images, to put CSS
declarations in common::

  h1.swap {
    height:22px;
    background-repeat:no-repeat; }

  h1.swap span {
    display:none; }


Centered elastic column with nice borders (no images)
-----------------------------------------------------

::

  #Content {
  	margin:0 50px 0 125px;
  	padding:3.5em 1.36em;
  	border-color:#666;
  	border-style:solid;
  	border-width:0 1em;
  	background-color:#eee;
  	}

  <body>

  <div id="Content">

  ...


Corner image at the bottom of the page
--------------------------------------

Place an image anchored to the bottom of the document::

  background: #fff url(/001/blossoms.jpg) no-repeat bottom right;
  margin: 0px;
  padding: 0px;

Summary: La lecture facile à l'écran
====================================

- common errors in choosing background image:

  - to omuch contrast
  - pattern that is too "alive" (i.e. eyes gets lost in it)

- ideal line length: 60 chars; at normal font size (3), 400px = 80chars

- paragraph ``<p align="justify">`` is <400px only.

- long text: you must give vertical cues

  - images
  - avoid fixed background at all costs
  - block of text ith one sentence (could be an image too)
  - underline and visible links provide anchoring for the eye
  - subsections with different style is good

- fonts

  - Times: originally designed for newspaper print

  - Verdana and Georgia (both from MS) were designed to be read on the screen

  - sizes:

    - ``normal`` could be anything on the client (good)
    - ``12pt`` forces client size (bad)
