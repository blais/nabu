It would be nice to have a cp-progress wrapper for the ``cp`` command, that
would also pop-up a little dialog that monitors the size of the file that is
copied.  I would make this program automatically visible from all workspaces and
it would show a special color/window when the copy operation is done, and
disappear shortly thereafter.
