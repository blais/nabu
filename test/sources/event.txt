     Each node class has corresponding methods, doing nothing by
     default; override individual methods for specific and useful
     behaviour.  The `dispatch_visit()` method is called by
     `Node.walk()` upon entering a node.  `Node.walkabout()` also calls
     the `dispatch_departure()` method before exiting a node.
