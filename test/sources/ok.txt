DJs. It also has its annual salsa competition - the most prestigious in

doors open. It has double salsa lessons - beginner and intermediate - also with
top Toronto instructors.

Left Bank has a friendly environment with three different salsa levels that are
taught simultaneously as the intro to Sunday salsa night.
