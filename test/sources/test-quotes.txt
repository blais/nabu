  "And he gave the boy his blessing.  The boy could see in his fathers gaze a
  desire to be able, himself, to travel the world--a desire that was still alive,
  despite his father's having had to bury it, over dozens of years, under the
  burden of struggling for water to drink, food to eat, and the same place to
  sleep every night of his life.
