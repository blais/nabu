- "Everything Bad Is Good for You: How Today's Popular Culture Is Actually
  Making Us Smarter", Steven Johnson

  http://www.amazon.com/o/ASIN/1573223077

    The author aims at convincing us that pop culture, modern television and
    video games have grown in complexity and are making us smarter.  He does
    this mainly by looking at the amount of facts to work in one's mind in
    today's entertainment vs. what used to be.  He claims that we should
    recognize that non-reading abilities are increasingly gaining value in the
    world.  I bought this book because I was puzzled by the question, and
    opposed to his point-of-view, and I must admit after reading the book I am
    still very much opposed to his point-of-view.  His reduction of the the
    number of cognitive abilities to simple acts of probing and telescoping does
    not convince me.  Pop culture *is* dumb.  Maybe the author has been watching
    too much t.v. himself.
