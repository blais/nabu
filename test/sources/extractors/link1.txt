==============================
  Test for Links / Bookmarks
==============================


Transform that finds links represented as line-blocks of less than lines,
where if it has three lines, the first line is taken to be a description,
the second line is a URL (reference), and the third line a comma-separated
set of keywords.  Like this:

  |   From Montreal -- Classifieds for Japanese living in Montreal
  |   http://www.from-montreal.com/
  |   montreal, classified, ads, japan

The following forms are also accepted.

  | Description of a link, no keywords
  | http://this-is-a-reference.com/target.html

  | http://this-is-a-reference.com/target.html
  | just, the, keywords

  | http://this-is-a-reference.com/target.html
