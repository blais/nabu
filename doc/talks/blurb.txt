:Abstract:


Desktop search tools (e.g. Google Desktop) build a database of the
information that is stored on your computer. Wouldn't it be great
if some of this desktop database could be used to automatically
feed your online blog, or a website?

Also, wouldn't it be immensely useful if the "types" of information
found in your documents could be automatically identified? (i.e. a
mini "semantic web", but for your own files) For example, by
finding all the "addresses" in all of your personal files, you
could easily build your address book.

Are you someone who uses plain text files instead of fancy
specialized programs to maintain your personal data?

If you find any of the above interesting, this talk is for you. I
am proposing a system, Nabu, built in Python using
ReStructuredText, Docutils and text files, that can be used to
collect "typed" data from those files and fill a remote database
with the extracted data. This data can then be used to feed a wiki,
a blog, a web site, or any other kind of presentation layer you
desire.
