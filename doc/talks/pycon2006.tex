  \frametitle{Motivation}

slide with the problem to solve


\end{frame}



- I write lots of little text files

  ... example ...

  - Configuration notes

    -> as these notes

  - Timesheet



What is Nabu?
=============

- show diagram




Example Extractor
=================

- go through an example of writing an extractor





Applications
============

- blog

  - selective delivery of information

    e.g. ``soft privileges'', a link that expires, that allows access to a
    specific resource, e.g. I want to share my image gallery with my boss

- calendar
- timesheet

- ...








Advantages
==========

- Any document structures can be reused and combined to provide a rich content



Downsides
=========

- You have to understand how restructuredtext gets parsed

  - You end up getting dragged into the docutils project a bit
  
  --> You can use rst2pseudoxml.py to easily debug and learn input syntaxes


Future Work
===========

- Support encryption in the publisher
- Support per-document options (... adds complexity)


Conclusion
==========
