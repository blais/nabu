   Instructions for trying out the Nabu installed on furius.ca.

.. contents::


Want to try out Nabu?  We installed a Nabu server on this machine.  You can
create a test account and upload some content to give it a try.

#. Download the Nabu publisher client.  Save it from `this link
   </nabu/bin/nabu>`_.

   - Make sure that you have a Python interpreter installed and that the version
     is 2.3 or greater;

   - Put the publisher in your path under the name ``nabu``.

#. Create a new user that will allow you to push content to our Nabu server:

   - go to the `user creation page </nabu/test/cgi-bin/nabu-newuser.cgi>`_;
   - follow the instructions.

#. Use the created user/password to configure your client, for the publisher at
   URL: http://furius.ca/nabu/cgi-bin/nabu-publish-handler.cgi

   - you can create a file in your home directory, with these contents::

       user = '<username>'
       password = '<password>'
       server_url = 'http://furius.ca/nabu/cgi-bin/nabu-publish-handler.cgi'

#. Create some documents.

   - create/edit a text file following the reStructuredText conventions anywhere
     on your local drive, with any text editor of your preference;

   - put the string ``:Id: <some-unique-id>`` anywhere in the first 1024 bytes
     of the file.

#. Publish the content.

   - invoke the publisher on the created document, or in the directory that
     contains it::

	nabu <filename>

     or, if you have many documents in that directory::

        cd <dir>
	nabu

#. View the contents of the database.

   - you will need your user and password to log in;

   - go to the `contents/debug page`__

     This is not very fascinating, but you can see what gets uploaded.  We will
     soon prepare some extractors to display the data in a more interesting way.
  
   - or go to the `example presentation page`__, a simplistic blog-like view of
     the contents that I'm fiddling with.

__ /nabu/cgi-bin/nabu-contents.cgi
__ /nabu/cgi-bin/nabu-example-presentation.cgi

For more information on client usage, see the `Nabu usage document
</nabu/doc/nabu-usage.html>`_.


Notes:

- this test Nabu server is setup for your enjoyment only, we may pull the plug
  any day, this is temporary, so you can try it out;

- we are not responsible for the content that gets uploaded by users.

- we are very very busy.  Contacting the author may result in long delays.  Try
  the various options in the publisher client.  If this does not work, we'll fix
  it soon.
