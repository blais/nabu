 CHANGES: nabu
===============

Version 0.91
============

- Fixed many bugs with per-user data stores.

- Completely ripped out SQLObject.  Less dependencies, less moving targets to
  fix.  The new code depends only on psycopg2 (or another DBAPI-2.0 compliant
  connection) for the database storage.

- Updated to use the latest (2005-12-19) snapshot of docutils.


Version 0.90
============

- Initial release.
