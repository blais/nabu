Current Devel
=============

- Fixed bug with events date parsing.

- Renamed the extractors consistently to "Extractor" and "Storage",
  respectively, because we put one instance of each in each file.
- Split document and doctree extractors between files.

Version 0.91
============

- Fixed many bugs with per-user data stores.

- Completely ripped out SQLObject.  Less dependencies, less moving targets to
  fix.  The new code depends only on psycopg2 (or another DBAPI-2.0 compliant
  connection) for the database storage.

- Updated to use the latest (2005-12-19) snapshot of docutils.


Version 0.90
============

- Initial release.
