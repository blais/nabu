<h1><a class="toc-backref" href="#id5" name="description">Description</a></h1>
<p>Assuming that a user can easily create text documents --this is the case for
most programmers and techies, we do this all day, and we all have our favourite
text editors-- this system allows you to store various kinds of data <em>across</em>
multiple documents.  You can create and maintain a body of text files from which
various elements automatically could get stored in an organized manner in a
database.</p>
<p>Nabu is a simple framework that extracts chunks of various types of information
from documents written in simple text files (written with <a class="reference" href="http://docutils.sourceforge.net/rst.html">reStructuredText</a>
conventions) and that stores this information (including the document) in a
remote database for later retrieval.  The processing and extraction of the
document is handled on a server, and there is a small and simple client that is
used to push the files to the server for processing and storage (think
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">rsync</span></tt>).  The client requires only Python to work.  The presentation layer is
left unspecified: you can use whichever web application framework you like to
present the extracted data in the way that you prefer.</p>
<div class="figure">
<img alt="doc/nabusit.png" src="doc/nabusit.png" />
<p class="caption">Nabu does not really fit into any single category... it is a simple
implementation of a simple idea that &quot;sits&quot; between all these things and that
can be used to feed data into similar presentation layers.</p>
</div>
<p>It is probably best illustrated by some examples...</p>
<div class="section" id="example-extracting-contact-info">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id6" name="example-extracting-contact-info">Example: Extracting Contact Info</a></h2>
<p>For example, imagine that you write several files about your travels, say, one
for each destination.  Most likely they contain various contact information.
You could insert them like this in any of your text files and they would
automatically be extracted to a global list of contact info:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
:Contact:
:n: Martin Blais
:e: blais&#64;furius.ca
:a: 1 rue de la Montagne, Mongueuil, France
</pre>
<p>You could use this to feed into an online address book system, or create a
birthday notification system for yourself by adding your birth date.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="example-blogging-system">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id7" name="example-blogging-system">Example: Blogging System</a></h2>
<p>Another example: you could easily build a blogging system by detecting documents
with certain bibliographic fields and a date at the top of document, for
example:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
Cookies and Cream Today
=======================

:Blog: general
:Date: 2005-06-25

Ahh, I like to talk about cookies and cream...
</pre>
<p>All you would have to do is present the documents in an orderly way, e.g. by
category, by date, just the most recent, whatever you like.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="example-automatic-bookmarks-list">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id8" name="example-automatic-bookmarks-list">Example: Automatic Bookmarks List</a></h2>
<p>Another idea: you could automatically extract all the URLs from the documents
pushed to the server (across <em>all</em> the files) and automatically build an online
RSS bookmarks feeder, where your bookmarks would be organized by keywords, maybe
even fetching the keywords in the respective documents from which they were
extracted.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="example-shared-events-calendar">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id9" name="example-shared-events-calendar">Example: Shared Events Calendar</a></h2>
<p>How about this one: I maintain a todo file in a text file, simply.  With a
simple convention, like:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
:Event: 2005-06-28

  - dinner with Hannah &#64; funky restaurant

:Event: 2005-07-10 13h30

  - presentation on quaternions (room C-117)
</pre>
<p>These entries could be fed automatically in a shared Nabu, for a group of
friends or perhaps co-workers, and presented as a shared online calendar,
perhaps password-protected for access by certain people only, or filtered
somehow.</p>
<p>There are many possibilities... I'm convinced I will find more serious uses for
this system as well, which is why I built it in a generic manner.</p>
<div class="important">
<p class="first admonition-title">Important</p>
<p class="last">If you have a commercial use need for a system similar to this one, the
author is generally available for consulting to implement customizations or
build a system on top of Nabu.  See <a class="reference" href="/home/consulting.html">contact information for consulting</a>.  I'm very interested in new ways to publish and
organize information online.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="customizability-writing-extractors">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id10" name="customizability-writing-extractors">Customizability: Writing Extractors</a></h2>
<p>Various simple extractors will come with the Nabu package itself, but we suspect
you will very soon want to write your own.  Writing extractors is very easy.</p>
<p>All of this is built using the very powerful <a class="reference" href="http://docutils.sourceforge.net">docutils</a> tools, which includes the
<a class="reference" href="http://docutils.sourceforge.net/rst.html">reStructuredText</a> parser and provides the data structures that represent your
source documents.  Extractors are simply docutils transforms that visit the
document structure (which is provided and saved by the Nabu system).  To add a
new type of entry, all you need to do is write code that visits the tree, finds
what you want, and write a simple object to store it in the way you prefer.  You
can use SQLObject or another library to store the data in a database or in text
files.</p>
<div class="note">
<p class="first admonition-title">Note</p>
<p class="last">At the moment I have not had time to write complex extractors yet, due to
work/time constraints, but I will soon write a system to selectively publish
lots of disparate documents using Nabu and the extractors I will write for
this will come with the Nabu distribution. I'll be happy to include external
contributions of extractor codes in the distribution if anyone cares to
provide them.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="target-audience">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id11" name="target-audience">Target Audience</a></h2>
<p>This system is made to be a simple as possible to use.  However, it is not
designed for your mother.  In order to be able to use this efficiently, you must</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>understand the conventions and simple no-markup syntax of <a class="reference" href="http://docutils.sourceforge.net/rst.html">reStructuredText</a>;</li>
<li>be able to edit simple text files.</li>
</ol>
<p>I suspect that this will cater to people who are already familiar with
computers.</p>

</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="features">
<h1><a class="toc-backref" href="#id12" name="features">Features</a></h1>
<p>Nabu is cool, because:</p>
<ul>
<li><p class="first">it is flexible: you can use</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>any text editor you like to edit the files;</li>
<li>any source code control system you like to store and maintain them (or
none);</li>
<li>any database for storage;</li>
<li>and any web application framework for presentation.  Nabu does not
dictate how the information is presented/served to the clients;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p class="first">you edit files <em>locally</em>, not in a bleeping web browser window (programmers
will appreciate the value of this), in your favourite editor environment;</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">the organization of the source files in subdirectories has <em>nothing</em> to do
with how the content is presented.  We use a unique ID system (similar to
arch) where your document to be published must contain a unique string to mark
it with that id.  You can put that string in a <a class="reference" href="http://docutils.sourceforge.net/rst.html">reStructuredText</a> comment or a
bibliographic field.  Unlike Wikis, this allows you to change the title of
your documents while keeping the possibility of a permanent link to them.</p>
<p>It effectively offers you a sandbox for creating content, and then how you
organize and present the content is dictated by ways that <em>you</em> decide, most
likely independent of the source file organization structure;</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">the input data can be scattered over many files, it does not have to be stored
in files per-category (for example, you don't have to store all your
&quot;contacts&quot; in a single &quot;address book&quot; file, they can be found within/across
all your body of published file and a server might present as a single list if
desired).  I conjecture that this may be closer to how humans think of this
data.  This body of files can be used to create a mind-mapping system;</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">we recognize that the value of the information lies in the source itself, the
text files.  This valuable source remains <em>with you</em>, and you are free to
manage them in any way you prefer, with any version control system you like
(if you want to do that).  You can completely dump the data stored in the
database and rebuild it from the text files;</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">various semantic chunks of content are automatically extracted from your
document.  These semantic things are easily written with little code and are
configurable.  Nabu comes with example content extractors;</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">a light-weight program with minimal dependencies is used to upload the files
to the server.  The server processes the files for content.  This maximizes
the potential that you will be able to use Nabu anywhere, on any platform.
The client only requires Python to work;</p>
</li>
</ul>
<div class="section" id="nabu-is-not">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id13" name="nabu-is-not">Nabu is not ...</a></h2>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt>Not a Wiki</dt>
<dd>Although we upload documents (like Wiki pages) to a server, it may
be that the presentation layer never serves the pages/documents themselves.
Maybe it just serves bits of information extracted from the files.  Also,
documents are identified by a unique string, and not by Wiki names.  This
allows one to use whatever title for single documents and to create permanent
links to specific documents (as long as the file ID is maintained);</dd>
<dt>Not just a Blogging system</dt>
<dd><p class="first">It can be used to add any document set to a database.
Organization by date and category is simply implemented, but not a
requirement.  You present the data set (which can be anything) in your
preferred manner.</p>
<p class="last">You could, however, very easily implement a flexible and very complete
blogging system using Nabu.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Not a Word Processing system</dt>
<dd><p class="first">It is not meant to just serve documents.  You
can use it to publish just the information that is found within documents,
used to contain that information.</p>
<p class="last">Also, you write your documents locally, but they have the limitations of
<a class="reference" href="http://docutils.sourceforge.net/rst.html">reStructuredText</a>, so it is not really like a Word processing system.  You
must use a simple text editor.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Not a generic data entry format</dt>
<dd><p class="first">Although you could potentially use it to
enter larges lists of similarly structured data, the overhead of document
processing does not make it the most efficient way to do this.  If you have
<em>lots</em> of similarly structured bits of human-editable data, it would probably
be better to write custom code to parse a known format rather than leverage
Nabu for this.  The <a class="reference" href="http://docutils.sourceforge.net">docutils</a> processing on the server is not extremely fast,
and if you need speed for lots of data (say, thousands of files), you will
probably find this too slow.</p>
<p class="last">However, for smaller sets of files, Nabu could be used this way.  Or if you
have to input various kinds of structures within different contexts which can
be grouped in files.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Nabu sits between all these things.  I do not know what to call it, so I just
call it &quot;Nabu&quot;.</p>
